This is a clone of the game Super Mario Bros made with raylib and C/C++

Here are some things u need to know :

This game uses multiple external libraries. These include raylib,tileson and jsoncpp.
Raylib is used for graphics while the other 2 are used for parsing and drawing tilemaps in the json format.
Make sure these are included ,compiled and linked correctly
All the graphical and audio assets are available in the assets folder. 
This project was built with visual studio so i didn't make a seperate 
MakeFile for building the game (sorry, i don't know to make one yet).
You can run the game by running the built executable.
Make sure your executable is in a seperate folder and that folder and assets folder
are placed in the same directory. If you don't do this the game just won't work.

This is all a passion project and not monitized. All copyright belongs to Nintendo.

Enjoy :)
